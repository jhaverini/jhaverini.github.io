                      What is a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      Most newborns experience their first moments in a parent's arms before being taken to the well-baby nursery. Critically-ill or premature newborns are instead rushed to a high-tech nursery to receive 24/7 specialized care.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The majority of NICU stays are unanticipated, with caregivers &ndash; 
                      some recovering from high-risk pregnancies &ndash; being separated 
                      from their newborns. That separation is proven to compound the trauma 
                      experienced by infants, parents, and extended family.

                      <li>
                        <b>Participatory approach:</b> a design approach shaped by years of studies that addresses the
                        shortcomings of prior models through a layout organized around a fundamental idea: that an infant's
                        caretakers are vital participants in the care team.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Spatial considerations:</b> a series of mutually-reinforcing spaces that take into consideration &ndash; along
                        with life-saving systems and technology &ndash; the patient, family, and staff's functional and emotional
                        needs.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      What makes a NICU <i>good</i> is its technology. We configured the systems-intense spaces to enable and extend the capabilities of the professional care team. By necessity, a NICU must be machine-like: clinical, precise, and sterile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      What lifts a NICU to the <i>next level</i> is its attention to the human condition &ndash; as experienced by the constellation of participants it serves. We prioritized the end-users that the space is meant to serve, rather than treating them as secondary to the technological aspect of the design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If the NICU walls could talk, they would tell you that they witness the extremes of human struggle in its overwhelming rawness of life and death: trauma, resilience, panic, ingenuity, loss, capability, tragedy, love, perseverance. Statistically, the emotional intensity of the NICU stresses healthcare professionals, families, and relationships to the breaking point. To better serve these individuals, we designed for their needs for a calm and supportive environment.

                      My Role
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      As a core member of the architectural team, I collaborated on all facets needed to take the project from paper to reality, from planning spatial relationships, to construction, to move-in: technology and systems coordination, concept development, jurisdictional approvals, and upholding design intent follow-through during implementation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This particular case study focuses on the user experience facet, which itself had many aspects to balance. 
                      <b>My task was to advocate for the end-users of a systems-dominated, technology-heavy space.</b> 
                      Our human-centered design approach prioritized the end-users' experiences along with &ndash; 
                      not secondary to &ndash; life-saving systems and technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As project designer, I progressively built iterations upon new and existing hospital planning research, direct end-user work sessions, feedback from trade specialists, and observations of workflow simulations via prototypes.

                    <p>
                      In order to improve the experiences of this diverse set of end-users, we needed to understand how they functioned in the pre-existing NICU. We kicked off months of research with walk-throughs of the NICU that was slated to be replaced.

                    <p>
                      Configured in a "traditional" layout, the department consisted of a single large room nursery with nurse stations outside of the nursery. Nurses monitored newborns through windows into the nursery and by making rounds through the room. The care team rolled in supplemental mobile equipment as needed. A small corner was kept clear for a few wooden rocking chairs where parents or volunteers could sign up for time slots to feed and hold newborns inthe shared space.

                      Researching User Experiences of Different Layouts
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      Leveraging a wealth of contemporanneous studies on NICU design innovations, including Kaiser's own research, we quickly immersed ourselves in the end-users' worlds. This helped us:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Understand strengths and weaknesses of different configurations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Further clarify major concerns for end-users and workflows, and ask new questions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Stay on top of new insights in a constantly developing subject area.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Prior to the project, Kaiser had evaluated various layout options to select their optimal approach. Two starkly different examples considered were pods and private rooms:

                    <p>
                      The pod layout model was essentially a traditional open-bay layout modified for smaller groups of isolettes &ndash; such as three rooms with six isolettes each instead of one room with 18. Pods are best monitored by a centralized bank of nurse stations. This approach was an improvement on the open-bay,  but there was still little to no room for parents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The private room layout model presented a dramatic operational change for staff. Nurse stations were distributed, rather than centralized, to achieve sightlines to patients. The layout required larger nurse stations to accommodate centrally networked computers to monitor multiple patients simultaneously. Each room accommodated a family zone.

                    <p>
                      Several hospitals were already piloting 1-2 private rooms in combination with pods or open bays. The NICU at SDMC was committing to all private rooms (with flexible configurations to connect rooms for twins, triplets, and quadruplets), using the valuable feedback gained from the pilots.

                    <p>
                      Unlike many product roll-outs, beta-testing in life-or-death situations s not an option. Kaiser appointed an expert panel that had spent six years refining best practices based on studies, tours, interviews, and low-fidelity full-size mockups to simulate procedures. Our team would be iterating on the resulting room templates.

                    <p>
                      At a macro scale, Kaiser's studies showed that an effective NICU department required proximity to certain departments that were located throughout the hospital's six floors. I helped to graphically communicate the roll-out plan iterations to help the client to visualize a consolidated birthing center and align logistics with their business goals. The diagrams synthesized logical adjacencies, maintenance of bed counts, and construction impact over time for both hospital management and Kaiser's national facilities arm to align with broader region-wide 10-year and 20-year plans.

                      With client input, we created visual tools to address the feasibility of phasing and disruption, which we updated monthly to adjust for new insights. While updates were manual, we had to identify the key data points to highlight and create a layering system to easily update a dynamically evolving plan in multiple dimensions.

                      Floor plans spatially delineated areas of active construction, peripheral impact, and completed construction for the larger seven-phase birthing center project, of which the NICU was one phase. Other important metrics were time-based: providing "snapshots" of adjacencies retained during construction while departments were still functional, and total versus available beds per department.

                      The phase-specific timelines provided a way to view a non-linear process linearly.

The plans and timelines helped them adjust inputs and develop a viable way to achieve their business goals.

                          Smoke containment suites and fire-rated walls.

                    <p>
                      An example to illustrate the interplay of considerations: Existing column locations affected, among other things, the patient rooms. For <b>staff</b>, patient rooms needed workflow uniformity; for the state <b>regulatory agencies</b>, floor areas must meet minimums; and for the <b>client</b>, bed-counts had to pencil out to justify the project. In other words, we needed to fit at least 30 isolettes with ample workspace with identical staff workflows, within a finite space.
         
                    </p>
         
                    <p>
                      The <b>building code</b> required us to divide the department into three "units" due to bed-count maximums. Each unit required dedicated amenities, tripling the number of those amenities to fit into our finite space.
                    </p>
         
                    <p>
                      <b>Fire codes</b> required areas to be divided into smoke containment suites, which limit travel distance to exits. Suite boundaries involve fire partitions with doors that shut when an alarm is triggered. (1) the suite would need to be configured to never allow a scenario in which an <b>infant</b> is separated from <b>nurses</b>; and (2) wall-mounted items in fire partitions are minimized to avoid penetrations, affecting patient room layouts &ndash; for which, again, identical workflows were crucial.
                    </p>
         
                    <p>

                      Diverse Approaches for Key Decisions: Two Examples

                    <p>
                      The private room design created a challenge for sightlines from the Nurses' seated locations to the infants' heads since infants were no longer collectively in one space. Maintaining monitoring capabilities involved geometric studies, procedural decisions, and the incorporation of new technology.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Bedside workstations in each room provided 1:1 monitoring where needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Sliding doors between room pairs allowed a nurse seated bedside to also monitor paired patient rooms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Nurses at fixed workstations outside of the patient rooms provided redundant sightlines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Advanced "central monitoring" systems displayed multiple infants' vitals simultaneously at workstations.
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                          Building elements and equipment could not obstruct the sightlines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Glass portions in doors needed to be maximized for view, yet minimized for privacy.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                      A seasoned design team knows its limits, and when to engage specialists for particular input. We enlisted consulting support for one of the most crucial pieces of equipment: the headwalls. 
                    </p>
         
                    <p>
                      Flanking the patient bed, the in-wall panels held most of the equipment, emergency call buttons, and hookups for suction, air supply, outlets, and plumbing. The headwalls had a major impact on space planning by <i>creating order</i>. They kept the equipment off of the floor, in standardized locations, with limited cords, and allowed for ergonomic setups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To converge on the best headwall configuration to serve the end-users, we arranged a series of meetings that allowed for each user group affected to identify its priorities with the headwall specialist and an ergonomist. Our design engineers also sat in to ensure that the design would be feasible given constraints of the existing building.

                    <p>
                      Once we identified and located the headwall features, sightlines, and other layout decisions, Kaiser accordingly built full-size mock-ups of critical rooms. These mid-fidelity prototypes were the evolution of the low-fidelity versions developed two years prior by the expert panel. The professional care team performed simulations of procedures to answer remaining questions and  fine-tune the layouts.

                      <b>Raised the bar and paved the way for future private-room NICUs.</b><br>With a design that was ahead of regulatory frameworks, we worked with jurisdictions to have seven "alternate methods of compliance" approved. In doing so, we set new precedents for achieving compliance within the intent of the Building Code. Unorthodox, but successful; and it paved a pathway to continue transforming and improving how NICUs can be implemented.
                    </p>
         
                    <p>
                      <b>Designed and oversaw successful implementation of a pioneering NICU, overcoming non-trivial challenges in the process.</b><br>By prioritizing the end-users' perspectives, we balanced numerous complexities &ndash; including accessibility, seismic, technical, procedural, budgetary, jurisdictional &ndash; without losing sight of the individual experiences of those in the NICU. Through construction, the design team worked with the implementation team to ensure that the built reality aligned with design intent.
                    </p>
         
                    <p>
                      <b>Contributed to a continuum of research.</b><br>The concept of a NICU is not even a hundred years old. In a shifting and developing area, we improved on prior knowledge,  delivering a functioning department from which qualitative and quantitative insights will further inform a growing body of knowledge on future NICU design.

                      <b>Indirectly helped ease end-users through difficult, often life-changing experiences.</b><br>Private-room NICUs are now being implemented worldwide. They increase the chances of both infant survival and improved quality of life; reduce the pressures that often break families and staff; improve prospects and outcomes of top-flight doctors; and create a better overall working environment.
