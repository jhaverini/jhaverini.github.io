                  <h3>Incentivizing longer life-cycles for the manufacture and reuse of durable parts</h3> 
                  
                  <p>
                    Iterant is a three-sided online marketplace platform (PaaS) powering the circular economy by furnishing its users with incentives that:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        drive a multiple-lifecycle approach to the manufacturing of parts;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        increase the reliability of supply chains for quality reused parts in predictable quantities; and
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        motivate the recovery of discarded parts for resale.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p class="goal">
                    I helped the team visualize what the circular marketplace would look like with its unique incentive-based features. The wireframes and prototypes I provided facilitated strategy discussions, helped successfully raise a first seed round of funding, and secured entry to Berkeley SkyDeck, a startup incubator.

                  <p>My Contributions</p>

                  <h3>Iteratively refined the business model through multi-stakeholder diagrams</h3>

                  <p>Working with the founder, I helped to visualize the convergence of manufacturing, supply chain, and recovery channels to build an ecosystem of reuse.</p>
    
                  <img width="100%" style="padding-bottom: 32px;" src="../images/projects/iterant/01-flow-new.jpg"/>

                  <p>Being involved at such an early stage, I served as a sounding board for the founder’s evolving business concept and reflected back to help hone the value proposition.</p>

                  <h3>Uncovered users’ goals with proto-personas</h3>

                  <p>Each of the three channels of commerce (manufacturing, supply chain, and recovery) involved a unique end-user with unique concerns and motivations.</p>

                  <p>Through online research and 1:1 interviews, I familiarized myself with two roles that exist in today’s manufacturing ecosystem: Inside Sales and Supply Chain Management. The third more novel role of “Collector” required some imagination: What are current mainstream roles that are <i>similar</i>? How might these adjacent roles <i>adapt</i> for the circular economy, and what incentives can motivate change given their respective goals?</p>

                  <h3>Guided discussion from theoretical to concrete</h3>

                  <p>
                    From boxes and arrows, to wireframes, to low-fi prototypes, I created artifacts to facilitate discussion and collaboratively refine the evolving concept to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Question assumptions that could affect foundational design decisions</li>
                      <li>Supplement pitch deck materials with visuals illustrating the business model to aid with funding, recruiting, and discussions on proof-of-concept </li>
                      <li>Prioritize must-have features for an MVP</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>Takeaways</p>

                  <h3>The early-stage start-up experience</h3>

                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Light touches were key -- even when thinking through a complex product, there were many moving parts in the works, and the team was still figuring it out.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When imagining an end-user who didn’t yet exist, it was helpful to focus on goals, and to talk to proxy end-users with similar goals.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        At the early stage, my role as a designer was important for facilitating conversation, not just finalizing deliverables.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It was helpful to <i>not</i> be an expert: asking naive questions was of incredible value.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
