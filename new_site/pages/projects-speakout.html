          <h3>Overcoming economic barriers</h3> 
          
          <p>
            While English is the language of commerce, government, and higher education in Bahrain, students can rarely gain functional proficiency from public school alone. SpeakOut provides low-cost, high-quality courses, taught by well-trained instructors using interactive modalities to propel students to mastery.
          </p>

          <p>
            To pay teachers fairly, support roles were bootstrapped. The school faced two critical pain-points: much-needed revenue lost due to unpaid tuition, and lack of registration follow-through due to missed placement test appointments. A solution was urgently needed as the school expanded to a second location.
          </p>

          <p class="goal">
            Our team conducted a two-week design sprint with the school’s founder. We workshopped scope, conducted background research, and then divided design work. I envisioned a new online registration flow and tested concepts on proxy-users. Finally, we presented findings, feature roll-out recommendations, and schematic designs for key screens based on proxy-user feedback.

          <p>My Contributions</p>

          <h3>Week 1: Scoping & Research</h3>

          <p>
            The team and SpeakOut’s founder first identified the school’s biggest need: broadly, to reduce educators’ administrative workload without increasing overhead. We identified online registration as highest priority, since it would establish the student database to support most other improvements.
          </p>

          <p>
            A website audit and journey mapping exercise revealed that the landing page, fees, and course info screens could use clarification in support of making registration more inviting.

            Week 1 toolbox included: stakeholder interviews, online research for context, comparative analysis, dot voting / polls, existing workflow audits, personas, journey mapping, card sorting, key user flows, crazy-8s, 4-step sketches

          <div class="spacer-small"></div>

          <h3>Week 2: Design & Testing</h3>

          <p>
            With multiple designers on the team, we divided tasks. I focused on the registration flow, while others worked on the style guide, website restructuring, and static screens (landing page, class schedule, fees).
          </p>

          <img style="width:100%; padding-bottom: 32px;" src="../images/projects/speakout/04-flow.jpg"/>

          <p>
            Starting with diagrams, I could quickly get feedback from the founder. I realized that registration would also require a mobile payment integration and a sign-in flow.
          </p>

          <img style="width:100%; padding-bottom: 32px;" src="../images/projects/speakout/05-wireframes.jpg"/>

          <p>
            By sharing a wireframe prototype, I learned that parents typically registered multiple children -- even teens. Creating household registration was unavoidable if we were going to propose a realistic solution.
          </p>

        <h3>Recommended future improvements</h3>

        <p>
          For our final day of the sprint, we demoed a low-fi prototype with a few key screens styled. We proposed a website redesign with added registration, sign-in, and payment features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our additional recommendations, in order of priority:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Toggle feature for Arabic (right-to-left text) versions of all screens
            </li>
            <li>
              Ability to take multiple choice portion of placement test online
            </li>
            <li>
              Calendar scheduling for oral placement tests
            </li>
            <li>
              Mobile notifications / reminders for payment and appointments
            </li>
            <li>
              An administrator-side dashboard
            </li>
            <li>
              Digital records access (grades, certificates, etc.) in Student Portals
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Takeaways</p>

        <h3>The design sprint experience</h3>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scope creep was a constant threat -- no one on the design team had participated in a sprint. It helped to review a brief PRD each morning for a group reality-check.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ideally, participants would have included at least one teacher, a parent, and a student from the SpeakOut community.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
