        <h3>Overcoming economic barriers</h3>        
        <p>
          While English is the language of commerce, government, and higher education in Bahrain, students can rarely gain functional proficiency from public school alone. SpeakOut provides low-cost, high-quality courses, taught by well-trained instructors using interactive modalities to propel students to mastery.
        </p>
        <img style="width:100%; padding-bottom: 32px;" src="../images/projects/speakout/01-students.jpg"/>
        <h3>Reducing teachers’ administrative load to keep English courses affordable</h3>
        <p>
          To pay teachers fairly, support roles were bootstrapped. The school faced two critical pain-points: much-needed revenue lost due to unpaid tuition, and lack of registration follow-through due to missed placement test appointments. A solution was urgently needed as the school expanded to a second location.
        </p>
        <p class="goal">
          Our team conducted a two-week design sprint with the school’s founder. After background research and workshopping as a group, we dispersed to design. I was responsible for conceptualizing a new online registration flow. We wrapped the session with feature roll-out recommendations and schematic designs for key screens based on poxy-user feedback.

        <h5>My Contributions</h5>
        <h3>Week 1: Scoping & Research</h3>
        <p>
          The team and SpeakOut's founder first identified the school's biggest need: broadly, to <strong>reduce educators' administrative workload</strong> without increasing overhead. We identified <strong>online registration</strong> as highest priority, since it would establish the student database to support most other improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          A website audit and journey mapping exercise revealed that the landing page, fees, and course info screens could use clarification in support of making registration more inviting.

          Week 1 toolbox included: stakeholder interviews, online research for context, comparative analysis, dot voting / polls, existing workflow audits, personas, journey mapping, card sorting, key user flows, crazy-8s, 4-step sketches
        </p>

        <div class="spacer-small"></div>

        <h3>Week 2: Design & Testing</h3>
        <p>
          With multiple designers on the team, we divided tasks. I focused on the registration flow, while others worked on the style guide, website restructuring, and static screens (landing page, class schedule / fees).
        </p>

      </div>       
      <div class="block-fg-narrow">
        <p>
          Starting with diagrams, I could quickly get feedback from the founder. I realized that registration would also require a mobile payment integration and a sign-in flow.
        </p>

      <div class="block-fg-narrow">
        <p>
          By sharing a wireframe prototype, I learned that parents typically registered multiple children &mdash; even teens. Creating household registration was unavoidable if we were going to propose a realistic solution.

          <h3>Recommended future improvements</h3>
          <p>
            For our final day of the sprint, we demoed a low-fi prototype with a few key screens styled. We proposed a website redesign with added registration, sign-in, and payment features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our additional recommendations, in order of priority:
            <ul>
              <li>Toggle feature for Arabic (right-to-left text) versions of all screens</li>
              <li>Ability to take multiple-choice portion of placement test online</li>
              <li>Calendar scheduling for oral placement tests</li>
              <li>Mobile notifications / reminders for payment and appointments</li>
              <li>An administrator-side dashboard</li>
              <li>Digital records access (grades, certificates, etc.) in Student Portals</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <h5>Takeaways</h5>

        <h3>The design sprint experience</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scope creep was a constant threat &mdash; this was everyones first sprint and we wanted to accomplish so much. It helped to begin each morning with a review of the PRD, treating it as a live document.</li>
            <li>Ideally, participants would have included at least one teacher, a parent, and a student from the SpeakOut community.</li>
          </ul>
