        <h3>Challenging the validity of one-sided historical narratives</h3>
        <p>
          Museums often focus on dominant perspectives; thus the need for <strong>public history</strong>, described as <q>...the preservation, interpretation, and representation of historical narratives, specifically highlighting the experiences of <em>marginalized and underrepresented peoples</em>.</q>
          <sup>1</sup>
        </p>

        <p class="goal" style="border-left-color: #B28650;">
          The client, a professor at St. Mary’s College, wanted an effective way to share her research insights with other public history academics. I built a website for her to also function as a supplemental reference for her new course offering, helping students unearth and highlight underlying relevant, richer, more inclusive narratives when crafting museum exhibitions.

        <h5> My Contributions</h5>

        <h3>&#x25b6; Proposed variations along schematic themes</h3>
        <p>
          Tapping into skills that I learned early in my career as a residential architect, I was able to feel out the client's goals, expectations, and tastes through quick vignettes on different schemes. This required careful listening, establishing a shared language, and avoiding jargon. We worked together one-on-one to hone a body of work that the client was passionate about.

        <h3>&#x25b6; Built an interactive website</h3>
        <p>
          I began with static diagrams and concepts in Figma. Rather than continuing with high-fidelity static designs and prototypes for hand-off, I chose a “no-code” website builder. This way, I could demo the staging site at any point and test a variety of navigation approaches, interactions, and animated effects.

          It was also important to choose an environment that permitted designer, client, and developer to work concurrently on design, content, and code. This invited participation and collaboration in ways that proved useful:
          <ul>
            <li>I could concretely communicate interactions and animated effects to a non-technical audience</li>
            <li>The client could make content changes based on the templates I had set up, giving her ongoing agency for her website as her research evolves</li>
            <li>The developer could override and customize behavior in a coding environment that they know, rather than having to adapt to another design tool</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

              The website-builders I reviewed were described as “no-code,” but some knowledge of HTML and CSS proved to be critical to learning quickly and troubleshooting.

              I was tempted by a relatively new platform that offered unique features. It was also an opportunity to support the maturing of a new, promising product. On the flip side, resources like user-created tutorials, tips, and tricks did not yet exist, and I had to be patient and allow time for bugs to be worked out.
