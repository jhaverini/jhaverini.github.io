                  <p>
                    Key Conservation enables an expert community of <strong>conservationists</strong> to ask any <strong>smartphone-carrying individual</strong> to infill urgent gaps in support. It empowers average individuals to affect change, and to track the real results of their specific contributions &ndash; no PhD required.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Organizations</strong> make up the backbone of the Key community. Their active involvement furnishes the content through which individual supporters engage and participate.
                  </p>

                  <p class="goal">
                    There were eleven “pilot” organizations, a number of whom had stalled during the onboarding process. I co-designed the org-side onboarding flow to improve follow-through while maintaining the rigorous vetting process desired by Key Conservation.
                    <br><br>
                    I co-designed a streamlined onboarding experience, and flipped the tone from one of suspicion to a presumption of good intention.

                  <h3>Identified the goal beyond the stated need</h3>

                  <p>
                    The project brief stated that more "on-trend" graphics were needed to improve onboarding follow-through. Our initial audit, however, revealed a daunting pre-existing application process spanning five platforms. It also required toggling between devices.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    After account authorization and authentication, the onboarding entailed 37 questions over two forms, a document upload, a five-page letter-sized reference pdf, twelve long-format inputs (mobile-only) which auto-formatted to a profile page, and two approval wait times.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We tested the pre-existing onboarding process with six proxy end-users. Five questioned the value of the app with respect to the effort required to apply.

                  <p>
                    While the called for the addition of graphics, our research pointed to a subtractive approach to redesigning onboarding.

                    Streamlined the onboarding user flow
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Mapping the pre-existing onboarding process helped us determine how we might improve it.

                  <p>
                    Informed by stakeholder meetings, proxy-user interviews, and analysis of other onboarding flows, we simplified the devices. platforms, questions, and wait times needed by proposing to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Make the website mobile-friendly
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ask only the questions necessary to complete the task at hand (with an explanation)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Demonstrate value upfront
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hold remaining questions for post-registration, as brief periodic or milestone-based surveys
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Group multiple screens and forms into four main steps
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h3>Rolled out the red carpet</h3>

                  <p>
                    Onboarding thus far had resembled a grant application, with extensive rules, forms, and acceptance tiers. Unlike a grant, however, there is <em>no obvious reward</em> for an organization to participate. Our approach was to demonstrate value early, and to change the tone to one of welcome.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Advocated for accessibility</h3>

                  <p>
                    While redesign / rebranding was declared off the table by the founder, we made the case to improve accessibility by expanding her color palette, and by changing to a typeface compatible with visual hierarchy on mobile devices.
                  </p>

                  <p>Takeaways</p>

                  <h3>Challenging a client's assumptions</h3>

                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        By basing design recommendations on user-centered research, we were able to make the case for some changes to the visual design to add usability and sophistication.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Initially asked to make onboarding more flashy to promote follow-through, we found that a subtractive solution was needed, rather than an additive one. As UX Designers, we brought value by asking "why" with an open mind.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
