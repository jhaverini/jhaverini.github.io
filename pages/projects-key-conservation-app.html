                    Why Key Conservation Matters
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Biodiversity ensures the resilience of habitats -- including human habitats. 
                    In the past, its care fell to an expert community of scientific professionals 
                    through research, policy, and fieldwork.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Key Conservation enables that expert community of conservationists to enlist 
                    any smartphone-carrying individual to infill gaps in support: from awareness of 
                    local surroundings, to equipment lending, to active volunteering of skills or 
                    time on urgent initiatives. It empowers average individuals to affect change, 
                    and to follow the effects of their specific contributions -- no PhD required.
                  </p>

                      Why Focus on Onboarding?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      The Key mobile app builds a community recruited from two groups: 
                      <b>Conservation organizations</b> and <b>individual supporters</b>. 
                      Organizations make up the backbone of the community. 
                      Their active involvement furnishes the content through which supporters engage and contribute.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The pre-existing onboarding process deterred the organizations that would draw in 
                      supporters. A majority of motivated “pilot” organizations stalled during the 
                      process. Less motivated proxy end-users interviewed stated that they were 
                      likely to abandon it prior to completion.
                    </p>

                    <p class="emphasis">
                      Our challenge: Redesign the onboarding flow to 
                      improve organizations’ follow-through in completing membership.

                  </h3>
                
                  <p>
                    Given an aggressive timeline, and limited access to both Key Conservation staff
                    and applicant organizations, we customized our approach to research:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Review the pre-existing onboarding process
                      </li>
                      <li>

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Comparatively investigate other onboarding flows
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The screenshots above show a lengthy pre-existing process spanning multiple 
                    devices: it entailed a fifteen-question form, a document upload, twenty-two 
                    detailed survey questions, a pdf how-to guide email attachment, 
                    a form with twelve inputs required to populate a profile, and two approval
                    wait times.

                    By diagramming the existing onboarding process, we exposed breaks in the 
                    user flow.

                  <p>
                    By diagramming the sequence of screens that the end-user 
                    encountered, above, we could easily spot the hurdles that 
                    likely contributed to drop-out:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Two multiple-day waits for approvals (red clock icons)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Five different environments to navigate between (horizontal bands)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Environments optimized for mobile-only and desktop-only viewing 
                        (device icons)                        </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A fundamental problem with the pre-existing approach: 
                    it assumed an abundance of applicants from whom to select, 
                    but without the outreach focus to realize that goal, only eleven 
                    pilot organizations had joined after years of product planning.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A more welcoming, guided approach could entice applicants, 
                    encourage completion of membership, and engage members to stick around.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Through interviews with the director of Key Conservation, 
                    we identified primary business objectives for onboarding:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Build trust:</b> Screen organizations to ensure legitimacy 
                        so that supporters don’t have to.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Engage:</b> Encourage active participation of organizations 
                        to attract supporters.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Excite:</b> Facilitate a process that builds applicant 
                        enthusiasm about potential gains from joining.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In parallel, we walked through the pre-existing onboarding process with proxy 
                    end-users -- representing organization account administrators -- and asked 
                    them to “think out loud.” The exercise revealed that end-users have a 
                    different set of primary objectives for onboarding:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Purpose:</b> Be assured that Key Conservation is a serious organization with a clear mission.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Value:</b> Understand time and energy input required versus value received, prior to 
                        commitment -- beyond the value offered by more established apps.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Ease of Use:</b> A painless path to begin participating.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                    Comparative Investigation of Other Onboarding Flows

                  <p>
                    We researched strategies used by other social-benefit mission-based apps, 
                    and apps in which one end-user group must be screened. AirBnB and various 
                    financial apps rely on a solid vetting process. World Wildlife Fund is 
                    well-known for motivating end-users to make donations. AirBnB Open Homes 
                    encompasses, at a high level, all of the challenge characteristics as

                      Our Biggest Challenge
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      We learned early-on that our client was passionately attached to 
                      the existing app design and processes -- because they were completely 
                      her creation. The client had imagined the features, designed the 
                      marketing materials, and had even drawn the artboards for the 
                      mobile screens.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In order to advocate for the end-user for a successful product outcome, 
                      the UX team had to thread the needle on multiple fronts:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>To accommodate, or challenge?</b> The client’s assumption was that 
                      visually stimulating graphics would solve the applicant follow-through 
                      problem. As UX designers, we evaluated follow-through at a fundamental 
                      level, and our research exposed structural issues that cosmetic adjustments 
                      would not fix.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      <b>To add, or to subtract?</b> The client’s proposed solution was additive 
                      -- spice things up with pre-selected dynamic backgrounds, on-trend graphics, 
                      and effects. Our findings suggested a subtractive approach -- simplify 
                      the process and visuals to help the end-user move quickly over the 
                      administrative hurdle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Wings, or roots?</b> The client’s ideas were big-picture and visionary, 
                      our appraisal of her ideas were detailed and evidence-based.

                    We simplified the information architecture, thereby smoothing out the user flow. 
                    In the pre-existing process diagram, we showed the five environments that the 
                    user must navigate.

                        Created a parallel track wherein the user can opt to complete

                    An Edge-cases Worth Considering
                  </h4>

                  <p>
                    The pre-existing onboarding process was front-loaded with survey questions. 
                    Key Conservation considers this a small request, needed to serve its members effectively. 
                    Organization applicants generally view it as a taxing upfront request, 
                    especially when they are still undecided on the app's value.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    An edge case: what if an organization administrator patiently answers pages of questions, 
                    only to be rejected due to a problem in their uploaded credentials? Given a lack of 
                    international credentialing standards, this was a relevant scenario to consider, 
                    especially once Key Conservation scales. The end-user will have wasted time for the 
                    benefit of a business that then rejects them.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This compelled us to propose an approach of grouping questions related to onboarding steps. 
                    We proposed pushing out periodic short in-app surveys upon completion of related user milestones,
                    after organizations' applications are approved.

                  <p>
                    Our primary objective was to improve onboarding follow-through. 
                    We found that end-users paid attention to the visual design to judge the app's value. 
                    Following are three examples of how we challenged the pre-existing visual design.

                    The original typefaces limited hierarchy options and were not mobile-friendly.

                  <p>
                    The pre-existing typefaces were bold for mobile devices, and their limited weight 
                    options made text hierarchy a challenge. We proposed two mobile-friendly options 
                    with multiple weights. Lato was closer in character width to the original Futura. 
                    Given the text-heavy content that the client had provided, Lato was the clear choice.

                    The pre-existing palette contrast ratios only met WCAG 2.0 AA compliance 
                    standards in limited combinations. Neon on black was eventually agreed upon as 
                    appearing off-message. This left few options to depict states and to differentiate 
                    primary focus, and no options for secondary focus.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We proposed alternative palettes reflective of conservation themes, 
                    but the client did not feel that they reflected of the brand.

                    Our solution was to retain the existing color palette, but expand on it to

                    The pre-existing brand graphics include a set of animal skin and fur textures. 
                    We were asked to incorporate them into the onboarding process as a means to 
                    engage the applicant.

                    We created a simple test in which fifteen participants were shown one mobile screen each and 
                    asked to guess the intent of the app. The left screen is the pre-existing design. 
                    The middle screen is a complete rebrand, using a highly emotive image. 
                    The right screen is a hybrid -- retaining the use of texture in the pre-existing 
                    branding and adding the element of emotion by including the animal's eye.

                    The fur-only textures were clearly off-message, but they were already so entrenched in the brand’s 
                    (and the client's) identity that change was off the table. We managed to keep the onboarding 
                    input screens graphics-free for clarity, on condition that we include timed transition screens 
                    that pull in the textures. On those screens, we proposed the textures with least potential 
                    to be associated with apparel.
