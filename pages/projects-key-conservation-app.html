                    Why Key Conservation Matters
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Biodiversity ensures the resilience of habitats &ndash; including human habitats. 
                    In the past, its care fell to an expert community of scientific professionals 
                    through research, policy, and fieldwork.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Key Conservation enables that expert community of conservationists to enlist 
                    any smartphone-carrying individual to infill gaps in support: from awareness of 
                    local surroundings, to equipment lending, to active volunteering of time and skills to address urgent initiatives. It empowers average individuals to affect change, 
                    and to track the effects of their specific contributions &ndash; no PhD required.
                  </p>

                    <h3>
                      Why Focus on Onboarding?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      The Key mobile app built a community that was recruited from two groups: 
                      <b>Conservation organizations</b>, and <b>individual supporters</b> &ndash; connecting experts and enthusiasts for a shared cause.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Organizations made up the backbone of the Key community. The app was structured such that their active involvement furnished the content through which supporters could engage and contribute.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The pre-existing onboarding process <i>deterred</i> the organizations needed to draw in 
                      supporters. A majority of motivated "pilot" organizations had stalled during the 
                      onboarding process. Less motivated proxy end-users who we interviewed stated that they were likely to abandon it prior to completion.

                    Given an aggressive timeline, and limited access to both Key Conservation staff

                  <p>
                    The screenshots above show a lengthy pre-existing process that spanned multiple 
                    devices: it entailed a fifteen-question form, a document upload, twenty-two 
                    detailed survey questions, a pdf how-to guide email attachment, 
                    a form with twelve inputs required to populate a profile page, and two approval
                    wait times.

                    By diagramming the sequence of screens that the end-user 
                    encountered, above, we could easily spot the hurdles that had 
                    likely contributed to drop-out:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Two multiple-day waits for approvals (red clock icons)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Five different environments to navigate between (horizontal bands)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Environments optimized for mobile-only and desktop-only viewing 
                        (device icons)                        
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A fundamental problem with the pre-existing approach: 
                    it assumed an abundance of applicants from whom to select; however,  
                    without the outreach focus to recruit hundreds of applicants, only eleven 
                    pilot organizations had joined, after years of product planning.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A more welcoming, guided approach could entice applicants, 
                    encourage completion of membership, and engage members to stick around.

                    We identified the key stakeholders for organization onboarding as Key Conservation (the client) and applicant organizations (the end-users).
                  </p>

                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Through interviews with the director of Key Conservation, 
                    we identified primary business objectives for onboarding:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Build trust:</b> Screen applicant organizations to ensure legitimacy 
                        so that supporters don't have to.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Engage:</b> Encourage active participation of organizations 
                        to attract supporters.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Excite:</b> Facilitate a process that builds applicant 
                        enthusiasm about potential gains from joining.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In parallel, we walked through the pre-existing onboarding process with proxy 
                    end-users &ndash; representing organization account administrators &ndash; and asked 
                    them to "think out loud." The exercise revealed that end-users had a 
                    different set of primary objectives for onboarding:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Align purposes:</b> Be assured that Key Conservation is a serious organization with a clear mission.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Offer value:</b> Understand time and energy required vs. value received, prior to 
                        commitment; beyond the value offered by more established apps.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Make it easy:</b> A painless path to begin participating.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    We researched strategies used by other social-benefit mission-based apps, 
                    and apps in which an end-user group must be screened. AirBnB and various 
                    financial apps relied on a solid vetting process. World Wildlife Fund was 
                    well-known for motivating end-users to make donations. AirBnB Open Homes 
                    encompassed, at a high level, all of the challenge characteristics as 
                    Key Conservation.

                    <h3>
                      Our Biggest Challenge
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      We learned early-on that our client was passionately attached to 
                      the existing app design and processes &ndash; because they were completely 
                      her creation. The client had imagined the features, designed the 
                      marketing materials, and had even drawn the artboards for the 
                      mobile screens.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In order to advocate for the end-user for a successful product outcome, 
                      the UX team had to thread the needle on multiple fronts:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>To accommodate, or to challenge?</b> The client's assumption was that 
                      visually stimulating graphics would solve the applicant follow-through 
                      problem. As UX designers, we evaluated follow-through at a fundamental 
                      level, and our research exposed structural issues that cosmetic adjustments 
                      would not fix.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      <b>To add, or to subtract?</b> The client's proposed solution was additive 
                      &ndash; spice up a boring process by using pre-selected dynamic backgrounds, on-trend graphics, and effects. The UX team's findings suggested a subtractive approach &ndash; simplify the process and visuals to help the end-user move quickly over the 
                      administrative hurdle.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                      <b>Wings, or roots?</b> The client's ideas were big-picture and visionary. 
                      Our appraisal of her ideas were detailed and evidence-based.

                    Some interfaces best serve end-users by inviting them to linger, while other interfaces are meant to be moved through with ease. The onboarding process fit the latter category, combining function and aesthetics to roll out the red carpet to member organizations.

                  <p>
                    Our primary objective was to improve onboarding follow-through. Graphically, we could boost Key Conservation's credibility by refining the design system. Following are three examples of how we challenged the pre-existing visual design.

                  <p>
                    The pre-existing typefaces were more suited for desktop headlines than for mobile device content, and their limited weights made text hierarchy a challenge. We proposed two mobile-friendly font families which came in multiple weights: Lato and Open Sans. Since the pre-existing content was so text-heavy, we chose Lato, which was narrower but did not compromise legibility.

                    Supporting Mission &amp; Message by Challenging Brand Imagery
                  </h4>

                  <p>
                    The pre-existing brand graphics included a set of animal skin and fur textures. We were tasked with incorporating them into the onboarding process as a means to engage the applicant.
                  </p>

                  <div>
                    <img src='./../images/projects/kc-app/4-501-brand-old.png' width="100%" alt="Pre-existing branding">
                    <p class="caption">
                      The marketing imagery promoting the Key App heavily relied on up-close animal textures.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Our first concern was whether the textures were sending the wrong message. We created a simple test in which fifteen participants were each shown one of the mobile screens below, and asked to guess the subject. On the left was the pre-existing splash screen. The middle screen reflected a traditional conservation aesthetic, with a highly emotive image. The right screen was a hybrid &ndash; retaining the use of texture, while adding context and emotion by including the animal's eye.
                  </p>

                  <div>

                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Responses for the pre-existing screen showed that participants correlated the image with pets rather than wild species; and apparel rather than live animals. However, the textures were central to the brand (and the client's) identity. Changes were off the table.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Our second concern was about clarity. From our research, it seemed unlikely that follow-through would improve with flashier screens. We proposed keeping form input screens free of clutter, and incorporating textures as backgrounds on timed transition screens. On those screens, we selected the client-provided textures least likely to be associated with pets or apparel.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The timed screens had the added bonus of reinforcing the new structure of onboarding steps, while aligning with the client's bright and bold aesthetic.
