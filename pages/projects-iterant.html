                Reuse at a large scale, for a sustainable planet
              </h3>

              <p>
                A cradle-to-grave approach to the life of durable goods is no longer sustainable. Individuals are now doing their part to divert waste from landfills, but at the <b>enterprise scale</b>, reuse is currently inconvenient and expensive - and that's where meaningful impact can occur.

                Enter <b>Iterant</b>: a pre-seed circular economy startup aiming to enable large-scale reuse. I worked with the founder to strategize on how manufacturing, supply chain, and recovery channels can converge at an online marketplace (PaaS) for reselling used products, at scale, with consistent quality and supply.

                Researching goals to indentify tasks
              </h3>

              <p>
                Identifying stakeholders' and end-users' was tricky since we were dealing with an early-stage, evolving business concept. It gave me the unique opportunity to serve as a sounding board for the founder's ideas and to reflect back. Every strategy discussion nudged us along an iterative loop. I found out quickly that the key was to focus on stakeholders' and end-users' goals rather than features and tasks (ref. About Face).

              <p>
                We needed to begin with proto-personas to shape the evolving three-sided marketplace. Mary Manufacturer and Betty Buyer represented the pre-Iterant partnership between an original manufacturer and supply chain manager. Iterant would help them meet their goals. Mary can continue to receive revenue for discarded parts with circular incentives. Betty can source less-costly parts without sacrificing quality and availability. Carl Collector exists in a post-Iterant world. We looked at similar roles, such as scavengers and used clothing sellers to approximate his rough persona.

                Externalizing insights to begin shaping a platform
              </h3>

              <p>
                While developing an understanding of the end-user and business goals, I started to envision the marketplace in a more concrete way for the founder to show potential investors. This also gave us a good visual to prioritize for an MVP.

              <p>
                We took a deeper dive into Mary Manufacturer's journey as she creates an Iterant catalog page with documentation for one of her company's parts. Mary uploads product info and sets incentives to signal to Carl Collector that he may benefit from reclaiming the parts from landfill. I gave the founder a crash-course in zooming, panning, and commenting in Figma to help facilitate a more nuanced conversation.

              <p>
                After dozens of iterations, we arrived at some key screens and a clickable Figma protoype demo, which the founder used to raise funds.  Iterant was recently invited to join Berkeley SkyDeck incubator program, PAD-13.
