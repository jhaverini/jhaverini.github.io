              <p>
                A cradle-to-grave approach to the use of durable goods is no longer sustainable. A lot of individuals do their part to divert waste from landfills, but at the enterprise scale - that's where meaningful impact can occur. I worked with the founder to strategize on how manufacturing, supply chain, and recovery channels can converge in an online marketplace for the trade and re-trade of products of  consistent quality and supply.

              <p>
                Part of a UX designer's role is to learn about the business concept and its stakeholders' goals. In this case, the concept was still being shaped. I was able to serve as a sounding board for the founder's ideas, and take part in strategy discussions with him and his technology advisor.
