                      An Architect turned UX Designer, I craft human-centered experiences for physical spaces &amp; digital interactions.
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                      My design sensibilities were forged in the crucible of <b>Cal Poly's College of Architecture &amp; Environmental Design 
                      (San Luis Obispo)</b>, and honed through a decade+ career as an architect in San Francisco, where I designed some of 
                      the places where people live, work and play today. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Practicing architecture in the Bay Area led me to projects for tech startups and gaming companies, where I 
                      discovered User Experience (UX) Design. I joined <b>MITâ€™s xPro Human-Computer Interaction Program</b>, and 
                      have been applying my sense of structure and space in the digital realm ever since.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      As an Architect, I turned wishlists into building designs, and guided those designs through construction. 
                      As a UX Designer, I turn wishlists into user interfaces (UIs), and guide these interfaces through implementation. 
                      In both contexts, I advocate for end-users, strive for seamlessness, and tame complexity: 
                      from mobile apps to campus master plans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Work aside, I enjoy getting my hands dirty with traditional materials: clay, glass, and wood.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I am also an avid social runner with a passion for after-run donuts. 
                    </p>
