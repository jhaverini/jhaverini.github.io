                  <h3>Problem: Transaction costs have a big impact on small businesses</h3> 
                  
                  <p>
                    Payment collection options for businesses are <b>slow</b>, <b>unsafe</b>, and <b>expensive</b>:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Account transactions take 3-5 business days to process</li>
                      <li>Checks and ACH expose account details</li>
                      <li>Forms are error-prone</li>
                      <li>Each transaction costs 2-3% of its value; roughly $1.7T are lost in fees, fraud, errors, and labor costs</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    By continuing to execute transactions on old infrastructure, everyone loses. <b>Small businesses</b> are especially impacted because they can't absorb the costs like big businesses and banks can.

                  <h3>HamiltonPay: Faster, safer, cheaper</h3> 

                  <p>
                    HamiltonPay is trying to make payment collection instant and secure, for a low flat fee, by rethinking the technology infrastructure. A key part of this overhaul is blockchain technology.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Blockchain is popularly associated with cryptocurrency, but another application is <b>smart contracts</b>. Transactions execute only when a limited set of parameters, via smart contracts, are met. HamiltonPay whitelists transaction pipelines to quickly process smart contracts between trusted partners. End-users' accounts stay private.  These approaches together are intended to make payments faster, safer, and cheaper. 
                  </p>

                  <h3>Designing within shared systems</h3>

                  <p>
                    <b>Understanding the data model:</b> Monetary transactions are complex. I first researched how end-users currently receive and make payments, and how banks process them. As a developer-led innovation, it was important that I understand, at a high-level, the intervention we were proposing. The focus for me became: how do I get the inputs needed in the back-end, with minimal requests to the end-users, while not violating privacy and while providing manual overrides for every automated solution. By removing any redundancies in requests to the end-users, identifying where mistakes typically occured, and finding out what information could be pulled from linked platforms with user consent, we could avoid errors.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>Using a design system to help rapidly build working demos:</b> During early stage, we used Tailwind UI, an off-the-shelf development framework with accompanying Figma components. With the large library of layouts, components, and individual elements, I created our own design system semi-custom design system that the developers could build quickly. I essentially created wireframes that appeared to be high-fidelity, which the team could quickly turn into working product demos to pitch for seed funding.
                  </p>

                  <div class="spacer-medium"></div>

                  <p>
                    <b>Maintaining consistency across product variants:</b> Our earliest adopters were independent fitness trainers who had moved their sessions and payments online during the pandemic. Next came independent medical clinics, whose payment collections were more complex. Bookended by the two were solo/micro entrepreneurs. Web developers would need an entirely different kind of site for documentation to add the HamiltonPay API to payment flows.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Our solutions needed to function similarly while addressing each group's unique needs. For that reason, most of my focus was on diagramming user flows with core similarities and varying feature "modules".
                  </p>

                  <img width="100%" src="../images/projects/hamiltonpay/03-flow-diagram.png">

                  <p>
                   We also wanted our solutions to visually belong together to keep demos simple at the early stage.

                  <h3>Rolling up the sleeves, in true early-startup spirit</h3>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the more typical UX responsibilities, I created marketing content: from creating landing pages and copy based on end-user feedback, to writing and recording demo voice-overs, to creating posters for our early adopters to spread the word.
