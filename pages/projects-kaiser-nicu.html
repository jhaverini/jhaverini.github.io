                      Two years prior to Isabella’s birth, I had been a part of the core architecture team that 
                      implemented a bold new approach to designing a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, 
                      rooted in Kaiser’s evidence-based research.

                    <p>
                      This is the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that played a key role in giving Isabella 
                      and others an improved chance at life.

                      What is a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      Most newborns experience their first moments in a parent’s arms before
                      being taken to the well-baby nursery. Critically-ill or premature newborns 
                      are instead rushed to a high-tech nursery to receive 24/7 specialized care.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The majority of NICU stays are unanticipated, with caregivers &ndash; 
                      some recovering from high-risk pregnancies &ndash; being separated 
                      from their newborns. That separation is proven to compound the trauma 
                      experienced by infants, parents, and extended family.

                        <b>Participatory approach:</b> A design approach shaped by years of studies that addresses the
                        shortcomings of prior models through a layout organized around a fundamental idea: that an infant's
                        caretakers are vital participants in the care team.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Spatial considerations:</b> A series of mutually-reinforcing spaces that take into consideration &ndash; along
                        with life-saving systems and technology &ndash; the patient, family, and staff’s functional and emotional
                        needs.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      What makes a NICU good is its technology: We configured the systems-intense spaces to enable and extend the 
                      capabilities of the professional care team. By necessity, a NICU must be machine-like: clinical, precise, and sterile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      What lifts a NICU to the next level is its attention to the human condition of the constellation of  participants 
                      it serves. We prioritized the end-users that the space is meant to serve, rather than treating them as secondary 
                      to the technological aspect of the design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If the NICU walls could talk, they would tell you that they witness the extremes of human struggle in its overwhelming 
                      rawness of life and death: trauma, resilience, panic, ingenuity, loss, capability, tragedy, love, perseverance. 
                      Statistically, the emotional intensity of the NICU stresses healthcare professionals, families, and relationships 
                      to the breaking point. To better serve these individuals, we designed for their needs for a calm and supportive environment.

                      My Role

                    <p>
                      As a core member of the architectural team, I collaborated on all facets needed to take the project from paper to reality, 
                      from planning spatial relationships, through construction and move-in: technology and systems coordination, 
                      concept development, jurisdictional approvals, and upholding design intent follow-through during implementation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This particular case study focuses on the user experience facet, which itself had many aspects to balance. 
                      <b>My task was to advocate for the end-users of a systems-dominated, technology-heavy space.</b> 
                      Our human-centered design approach prioritized the end-users’ experiences along with &ndash; 
                      not secondary to &ndash; systems and technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As project designer, I progressively built iterations upon new and existing hospital planning research, 
                      direct end-user work sessions, feedback from trade specialists, and observations of workflow simulations 
                      via prototypes. My role also included:

                    <p>
                      In order to improve the experiences of this diverse set 
                      of end-users, we needed to understand how they functioned 
                      in the pre-existing NICU. We kicked off months of research
                      with walk-throughs of the NICU that was slated to be replaced.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Configured in a “traditional” layout, the department consisted 
                      of a single large room nursery with nurse stations outside of the nursery. 
                      Nurses monitored newborns through windows into the nursery and by making 
                      rounds through the room. The care team would roll in supplemental equipment, 
                      mostly mobile, as needed. A small corner was kept clear for a few wooden 
                      rocking chairs where parents or volunteers could feed and hold newborns 
                      during their allotted times.

                      Leveraging a wealth of contemporanneous studies on NICU design innovations, 
                      including Kaiser’s own evidence-based research, we quickly immersed ourselves 
                      in the end-users’ worlds. This helped us:

                    <p>
                      Prior to the project, Kaiser had evaluated various layout options to select
                      their optimal approach. Two starkly different examples considered were 
                      pods and private rooms:

                      <!--Col 1: Old Caption -->
                      <div style="flex:1">
                        <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">“Pod” configuration</p>
                      </div>
                      <!--Col 2: Spacer -->
                      <div style="flex:0 0 5px;"></div>

                        <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;" >Private room configuration</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                      The pod layout model was essentially a traditional open-bay layout modified for 
                      smaller groups of isolettes &ndash; each room with closer to 6 isolettes instead of 30. 
                      Pods functioned best with a centralized bank of nurse stations to monitor patients. 
                      With this approach, there was still little or no room for parents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The private patient room layout model presented a dramatic operational change for staff. 
                      Nurse stations were distributed, rather than centralized, to achieve sightlines to patients. 
                      The layout required larger nurse stations to accomodate a “central monitoring system” &ndash; 
                      networked screens to monitor multiple patients simultaneously. Each room could have a family zone. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Several hospitals were already piloting 1-2 private rooms in combination with pods or open bays. 
                      The NICU at SDMC would be among the firsts to commit to all private rooms (which could be reconfigured, 
                      when necessary, into semi-privates for twins to quadruplets), using the valuable feedback gained 
                      from the pilots.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      A “Content Expert Panel” (CEP) &ndash; individuals representing different end-users, architects, 
                      engineers, and national facilities managers &ndash; had spent six years developing and recommending 
                      an overhaul of best practice standards to be adopted for future Kaiser NICUs. Based on research 
                      papers, tours, interviews, building codes, budget feasibility, and low-fidelity mockups for workflow 
                      simulations, the CEP came up with a set of room templates.
