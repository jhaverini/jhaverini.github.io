                    <p>
                      Most newborns experience their first moments in a parent’s arms before being taken to the well-baby nursery. Critically-ill or premature newborns are instead rushed to a high-tech nursery to receive 24/7 specialized care.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The majority of NICU stays are unanticipated, with caregivers &ndash; 
                      some recovering from high-risk pregnancies &ndash; being separated 
                      from their newborns. That separation is proven to compound the trauma 
                      experienced by infants, parents, and extended family.

                      <li>
                        <b>Participatory approach:</b> a design approach shaped by years of studies that addresses the
                        shortcomings of prior models through a layout organized around a fundamental idea: that an infant's
                        caretakers are vital participants in the care team.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Spatial considerations:</b> a series of mutually-reinforcing spaces that take into consideration &ndash; along
                        with life-saving systems and technology &ndash; the patient, family, and staff’s functional and emotional
                        needs.
                      </li>

                    <p>
                      What makes a NICU good is its technology. We configured the systems-intense spaces to enable and extend the capabilities of the professional care team. By necessity, a NICU must be machine-like: clinical, precise, and sterile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      What lifts a NICU to the <i>next level</i> is its attention to the human condition &ndash; as experienced by the constellation of participants it serves. We prioritized the end-users that the space is meant to serve, rather than treating them as secondary to the technological aspect of the design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If the NICU walls could talk, they would tell you that they witness the extremes of human struggle in its overwhelming rawness of life and death: trauma, resilience, panic, ingenuity, loss, capability, tragedy, love, perseverance. Statistically, the emotional intensity of the NICU stresses healthcare professionals, families, and relationships to the breaking point. To better serve these individuals, we designed for their needs for a calm and supportive environment.

                      My Role
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      As a core member of the architectural team, I collaborated on all facets needed to take the project from paper to reality, from planning spatial relationships, to construction, to move-in: technology and systems coordination, concept development, jurisdictional approvals, and upholding design intent follow-through during implementation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This particular case study focuses on the user experience facet, which itself had many aspects to balance. 
                      <b>My task was to advocate for the end-users of a systems-dominated, technology-heavy space.</b> 
                      Our human-centered design approach prioritized the end-users’ experiences along with &ndash; 
                      not secondary to &ndash; life-saving systems and technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As project designer, I progressively built iterations upon new and existing hospital planning research, direct end-user work sessions, feedback from trade specialists, and observations of workflow simulations via prototypes.

                      Configured in a “traditional” layout, the department consisted of a single large room nursery with nurse stations outside of the nursery. Nurses monitored newborns through windows into the nursery and by making rounds through the room. The care team rolled in supplemental mobile equipment as needed. A small corner was kept clear for a few wooden rocking chairs where parents or volunteers could sign up for time slots to feed and hold newborns inthe shared space.

                      What did the NICU experience look like to our end-users?
                      What were their goals, and what did they need to achieve them? 
                      The NICU was the stage set for a host of characters, each with 
                      different &ndash; and often competing &ndash; concerns that we balanced:

                      Researching User Experiences of Different Layouts
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      Leveraging a wealth of contemporanneous studies on NICU design innovations, including Kaiser’s own research, we quickly immersed ourselves in the end-users’ worlds. This helped us:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Understand strengths and weaknesses of different configurations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Further clarify major concerns for end-users and workflows, and ask new questions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Stay on top of new insights in a constantly developing subject area.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Prior to the project, Kaiser had evaluated various layout options to select their optimal approach. Two starkly different examples considered were pods and private rooms:

                      </div>

                    <p>
                      The pod layout model was essentially a traditional open-bay layout modified for smaller groups of isolettes &ndash; such as three rooms with six isolettes each instead of one room with 18. Pods are best monitored by a centralized bank of nurse stations. This approach was an improvement on the open-bay,  but there was still little to no room for parents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The private room layout model presented a dramatic operational change for staff. Nurse stations were distributed, rather than centralized, to achieve sightlines to patients. The layout required larger nurse stations to accommodate centrally networked computers to monitor multiple patients simultaneously. Each room accommodated a family zone.

                      Understanding the Design Team’s Position in the Continuum of NICU Research
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      Several hospitals were already piloting 1-2 private rooms in combination with pods or open bays. The NICU at SDMC was committing to all private rooms (with flexible configurations to connect rooms for twins, triplets, and quadruplets), using the valuable feedback gained from the pilots.

                      Unlike many product roll-outs, beta-testing in life-or-death situations s not an option. Kaiser appointed an expert panel that had spent six years refining best practices based on studies, tours, interviews, and low-fidelity full-size mockups to simulate procedures. Our team would be iterating on the resulting room templates.
